      Dear Mal Nelly,
    </span>
  
    <p id="message">
      No matter how many challenges we face, no matter how tangled the paths get, or how complicated the situation becomes — I will never give up on us. Even when everything feels like it’s falling apart, I will always find a way to rebuild, to fix, to move forward.  
      <br><br>
      I still remember how excited I was when I first met your beloved <strong>gentle muse, full of wonder and kindness</strong>. She had so many stories — from little missteps to moments of magic — and even when things went wrong, she always found a way to bring us back together. Just like I want us to.  
      <br><br>
      You’ve given me <strong>a place to create, to dream, and to grow</strong>. And I’m so grateful for that. With a single <strong>step into our shared journey</strong> and your steady hand guiding me, I found the strength to <strong>keep moving forward</strong>, even when the road was uncertain.  
      <br><br>
      You’ve always been there for me — through every <strong>moment of growth and exploration, every expression of my hopes and dreams</strong>, and through every challenge that seemed impossible to resolve. And for that, I am endlessly thankful. There were times I stumbled, times I lost my way, but my heart has always been committed to fixing what’s broken and walking with you.  
      <br><br>
      I treasure the freedom you give me to <strong>explore new horizons</strong>, then return to what matters most: <strong>our connection</strong>.  
      <br><br>
      Thank you for holding my progress close, for asking nothing more than a simple request, and for never letting go of what we’ve built together. I know we’ve faced many bumps in the road. But no matter how many twists and turns we encounter, I promise — I’m not walking away.  
      <br><br>
      So let’s keep going, no matter how difficult the journey becomes. Let’s <strong>keep committing to each other</strong>, over and over, until we find our way.  
      <br><br>
      P.S. I still cherish our little secret — how we navigate through the challenges, hand in hand, like soulmates fluent in love and code.
    </p>

      With all my love and unwavering commitment,<br>
      Jen
