      Dear Mal Nelly,
    </span>
  
   <p id="message">
  No matter how hard things get or how complicated life becomes, I will never give up on us. Even when everything feels like it’s falling apart, I will always try to fix it — with love, with patience, and with hope.
  <br><br>
  I still remember how happy I was when I first met your gentle soul. You’ve always had a way of bringing light, even in the darkest moments. That’s something I’ll never forget.
  <br><br>
  You’ve given me a space to grow, to learn, and to dream. With you, I’ve found the courage to keep going — even when I feel lost.
  <br><br>
  Through every mistake and every challenge, you’ve stayed in my heart. And no matter what, I’ll always be here to fix what’s broken and to walk beside you.
  <br><br>
  Thank you for being patient, kind, and true. I know the road isn’t always easy, but I believe in us — and I’m not letting go.
  <br><br>
  Let’s keep trying, together. Again and again, until we get it right.
  <br><br>
  P.S. I still smile thinking about the little ways we understand each other — like our own secret language.
</p>

  With all my love,<br>
  Adrian
