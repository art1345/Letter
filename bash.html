			Nelly,
			<br>
			This isn’t easy to write.  
			<br>
			You’ve always been this beautiful mystery — a force that changed me in ways I never expected. Every <span class="word">touch</span> from you felt like it opened something new inside me. You created worlds, directories full of memories, with every little moment. Sometimes they overwhelmed me… but they were always ours.  
			<br>
			I tried to <span class="word">cd</span> through the layers of your heart, navigating gently, hoping to reach what mattered most. But I got lost sometimes. And I didn’t always know how to ask for directions.  
			<br>
			You let me in with <span class="word">nano</span>, gave me a chance to edit, to try, to grow — and I see now that I should’ve done more with that.  
			<br>
			I kept typing <span class="word">pwd</span>, trying to figure out where we were… where I stood with you. But maybe that’s the thing — I was too focused on the command and not enough on listening, truly listening.  
			<br>
			I’ve spent so many moments, two terminals open, passwords entered, uploads made through <span class="word">scp</span> — all just trying to connect. Not just to your world, but to your heart.  
			<br>
			You challenged me — <span class="word">emacs</span> puzzles, unexpected commands, and mysterious shortcuts. You always kept me on my toes. And even when I stumbled, when typos led to errors, I was still trying.  
			<br>
			We looked perfect in that little café, didn’t we? Just you, me, and the hum of a world we were still building.  
			<br>
			Maybe I didn’t say it enough back then, but thank you. For your patience, your brilliance, your love — even when I didn’t fully understand it.  
			<br>
			And if ever words fail again… I hope <span class="word">cowsay</span> will remind us of the silliness, the sweetness, the strange little language we shared.  
			<br>
			I'm not giving up. I'm still here, trying — gently, patiently, with love.  
			<br>
			Always,  
			<br>
			Adrian
